# Home Device Controller

This project is aimed to create an automated system of devices connected to a Raspberry PI using its GPIO pins. In this version, two irrigators are controlled autonomously with the output pins of the Raspberry PI. This project, however, can be extended to control a vast array of other devices with the power of Raspberry PI pins.
